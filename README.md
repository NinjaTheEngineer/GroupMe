Private Social Network - groupMe

groupMe is a private social network that works by groups, each group has its own feed, chat, and information.
To be part of a group you will need to create a new group or join an existing one by entering a valid invite code.
Users can have multiple groups but can only choose one active one at a time, so you have plenty of information but you filter
what you want to see whenever you want, but choosing your active group or changing to another one. groupMe used Backendless as
its backend platform for all different services, like user management, database management, file services, messaging services,
and much more.
